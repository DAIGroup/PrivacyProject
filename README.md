# PrivacyProject
The source code of this project has been developed as part of a PhD thesis about Visual Privacy Protection.
Specifically, it consists in the protection of individual's privacy appearing in images and videos. For this
purpose, a protection scheme is proposed that is based on visualisation models in order to have several privacy
levels, where each one provides a different balance between privacy protection and intelligibility. In turn,
this protection scheme enables individuals to specify their privacy preferences concerning given circumstances
and a desired privacy level. This way, whenever such circumstances are detected, the preferred privacy level is
automatically applied. As it can be guessed, the proposed scheme has to rely on the context in order to do this.
